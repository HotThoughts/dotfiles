## Sync dotfiles in a new computer
- Setup your dotfile repo, and clone the bare repo to the new computer home directory
```
git clone --bare https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

- Add alias to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` so that you can use `dotfiles` as `git`
```
alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=~/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=~'
```

- Checkout repo
`dotfiles checkout`

##  Useage

- add changes to stage
```
dotfiles add .zshrc
```

```
dotfiles commit -m "message"
```

- push commit to your remote repo
```
dotfiles push
```
